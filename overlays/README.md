# Overlays

Files in this directory run automatically as part of each build. Some common ways I've used overlays in the past:

* Applying patches
* Downloading different versions of files (locking to a version or trying a fork)
* Workarounds and stuff I need to run temporarily

See `10-feather-font.nix` for an example.
